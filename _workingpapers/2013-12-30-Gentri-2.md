<small>Redevelopment is a major source of housing supply in dense cities, but it is spatially
concentrated and often associated with gentrification and displacement. This paper
studies the equilibrium consequences of redevelopment and of policies that restrict
it. We first empirically evaluate a teardown tax implemented in two Chicago neighborhoods
using a spatial difference-in-differences design and find that it substantially
reduced demolitions and modestly curbed displacement. We then develop a dynamic
general equilibrium model with forward-looking landlords who choose when to redevelop
and heterogeneous households who choose across neighborhoods and vertically
differentiated housing units. Redevelopment affects income sorting across neighborhoods
and generates filtering dynamics over time. Model counterfactuals show that a
spatially targeted teardown tax preserves old, affordable housing in treated areas but
shifts redevelopment to untreated areas, raising rents there. The policy benefits lowincome
households but harms middle- and high-income households, with the largest
losses for the middle. Land values fall in treated areas and rise elsewhere. We conclude
with a discussion of the policy implications of our findings. </small>
