<br/>
<small>Since 2000, housing markets across Canada have experienced growth rates in prices
that far exceed corresponding rates of household income growth. However, rents have
grown at similar rates to household incomes. Annual per capital housing unit new
construction rates have remained steady at about 0.007 across all types of markets
since 1991, with the composition shifting markedly from single-family homes to multifamily structures.
Purpose-built rental construction has recently risen from very low
levels. To understand these patterns, we consider local regulatory environments and
infrastructure provision, rental housing supports, sources of housing demand growth,
and Canada’s macroprudential regulatory institutions and environment.
