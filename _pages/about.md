I am a PhD student in economics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca). \
<br/>
I'm interested in **urban, real estate and spatial economics**. 
Most of my work studies the **regulation of housing markets**. 

I am on the job market in 2024/25. You can find my CV [here.](../files/CV-JamesMacek_JM.pdf) Thanks for your interest!
