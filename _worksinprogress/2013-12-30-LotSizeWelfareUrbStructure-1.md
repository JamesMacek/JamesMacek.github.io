<small>In this paper, I consider the effect of minimum lot size regulation on welfare and urban
structure. I show that minimal lots are the most expensive in the low-density neighborhoods
of productive cities, and this can explain the sorting on income into these cities and neighborhoods.
Motivated by this evidence, I construct a general equilibrium model in which households
of heterogeneous incomes choose cities and neighborhoods, value affluent neighbors,
and are burdened differently by regulation. A counterfactual deregulation exercise shows
significant and progressive gains for renters that may offset the losses to landowners. The
exercise also reveals two surprising results. First, any productivity gains that occur from the
expansion of productive cities is largely nullified by the out-migration of affluent households
who prefer regulated neighborhoods. Second, the neighborhood choice externality arising
from the demand for affluent neighbors matters little for the average household, but has important
distributional consequences. These results suggest that the most important consequence
of deregulating housing markets is increasing housing affordability. </small>
